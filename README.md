A home automation system


goals
=====

The goal of this project is to manage my home automation
and multimedia parts with a simple web UI.
It runs on a raspberry pi.
Currently this involves:
- switching lights
- opening/closing shutters
- switching my videoprojector
- setting up an alarm clock
- downloading and playing videos
It aims to be more modular, and auto declarative,
   and that's what's going on in the mqtt branch.
